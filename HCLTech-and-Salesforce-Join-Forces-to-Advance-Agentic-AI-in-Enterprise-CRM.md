In a significant move aimed at reshaping enterprise customer relationship management (CRM), HCLTech and Salesforce have expanded their partnership to bring agentic AI capabilities into core business operations. This collaboration is designed to deliver powerful, intelligent CRM solutions that support personalized experiences, autonomous workflows, and higher levels of efficiency across enterprise functions.
What Is Agentic AI and Why It Matters
Agentic AI is rapidly gaining attention in enterprise tech circles. Unlike traditional AI models that respond to user commands or pre-programmed logic, agentic AI involves autonomous, proactive systems often referred to as AI agents that can sense, decide, and act on behalf of users or teams.
In the context of CRM, this means smarter automation. AI agents can now handle tasks like qualifying leads, resolving customer service issues, and initiating personalized marketing outreach, often without direct human oversight. This shift marks a significant leap in how enterprises use digital technologies to drive value and customer satisfaction.
Strengthening the AI Force with Salesforce Technology
HCLTech has long been recognized for its engineering expertise and digital innovation. By deepening its integration with Salesforceâ€™s advanced technologies including Salesforce Einstein and other AI-native capabilities HCLTech is enhancing its AI Force platform, a proprietary suite of solutions designed to power digital employees and intelligent operations.
The partnership enables enterprises to create intelligent, autonomous workflows within their existing Salesforce ecosystems. As a result, organizations can reduce manual efforts, streamline operations, and provide faster, more meaningful customer interactions at scale.
Business Impact Across Key Industries
The enhanced CRM capabilities are expected to deliver immediate value to sectors such as retail, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing, where real-time customer engagement and operational speed are critical. By deploying agentic AI into these environments, businesses can expect:
Reduced response times in customer service


Smarter, data-driven decision-making in sales and marketing


Improved personalization and customer satisfaction


Enhanced productivity through automation of routine tasks


A New Era of Intelligent CRM
This partnership signifies a broader trend in enterprise transformation: moving from reactive systems to proactive, intelligent ecosystems. With agentic AI at the core, businesses no longer need to rely on static CRM processes. Instead, they can build adaptive platforms that learn, optimize, and evolve with every customer interaction.
As agentic technologies mature, collaborations like that of HCLTech and Salesforce will be key in helping enterprises unlock their full potential in a digital-first economy.
